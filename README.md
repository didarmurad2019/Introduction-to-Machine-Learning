# My recommendation
# Step-1: Make sure Python and pip are installed, Python in your Local computer
Any version suggestion download 1-2 old version (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Just for check go through python --version or python3 --version
pip --version
If these commands fail, you need to install Python first: (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Upgrade pip (optional but recommended) python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Step-2: Install Jupyter Lab via pip 
Use command pip install jupyterlab
On some systems you might need python3 -m pip install jupyterlab
Launch JupyterLab
After installation, start JupyterLab with: use command jupyter lab
This will open JupyterLab in your default web browser.
The terminal will show a URL like http://localhost:8888/lab.
